## Software

I use [REAPER](http://reaper.fm) with [SWS / S&M extension](http://www.sws-extension.org/) and [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) repository of scripts. [I've written my own as well](https://github.com/ply/ReaScripts/). Some of them allow [Source/Destination editing](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=232697)

I also try to be familiar with [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools), despite I don't use it on daily basis. I sometimes check [these](http://www.keyxl.com/aaac31a/263/DigiDesign-ProTools-7-keyboard-shortcuts.htm) [two](http://www.protoolskeyboardshortcuts.com/pro-tools-2018-keyboard-shortcuts/) lists of keyboard shortcuts. I've heard it's possible to use [4-point editing](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/unlink-timeline-edit-selections) technique too.
